# Classification-of-fashion-items

Fashion item classification is a crucial task in the e-commerce domain, enabling efficient product categorization and search functionality. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for image classification, demonstrating remarkable accuracy in identifying and distinguishing various objects. This project explores the application of CNNs to classify fashion items using the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

The application of CNNs to fashion item classification has revolutionized the e-commerce industry, enabling more accurate product categorization and enhancing user experience. The MNIST Fashion dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for evaluating and comparing different CNN architectures and training strategies for fashion item classification tasks.
